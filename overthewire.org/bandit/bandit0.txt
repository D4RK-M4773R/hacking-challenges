i so overcomplecated this level.
when you log in via ssh , you can see the content with ls command.
there you will see a readme file and with cat command , you can see the contents.

well there is a 32 character string .
i first thought it's kind of hash or something since the caracters are all random 
but after visiting various websites and failing , suddenly i thought "what if this string is the password itself ??? "

well yeah .
that is the password XD
